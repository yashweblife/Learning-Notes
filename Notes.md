This is a collection of theories I'm revisiting or learning anew.
The foundation behind doing something so dull is simply to offer cannon fodder to my knowledge base and quench my boredom.

From my years of admittance into various eduction systems, i have come to learn that the best way to study is to do you yourself. My experience with learning has thought me that the best way to grant knowledge is to have an end goal associated with what you are learning. For example if you want to make a simple game engine, the knowledge of vectors comes in handy. If you want to make a position tracker using arduino, the idea of calculus comes in handy. Similarly, if you want to make a robot you learn C/C++ and for websites you learn HTML/CSS/JS
